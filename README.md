# GroupProject

This is a repository for your group project.

Please carefully read the group project document available on the Blackboard for more details.

## Initial Setup

If you see this page, it means you've already accepted the group assignment from the GitHub Classroom.
Now, the first thing your group should do is to decide on an open-source legacy software system your group will work on. 

### Selection Criteria

You are free to select the subject software system, but considering the learning objectives and the scope of this project, the subject system *must* satisfy all the following criteria:
- It is an open-source software system available on GitHub.
- Its main programming language is Python (more than 80%).
- More than a year has passed since the first commit.
- The total number of commits is more than 20.
- The total number of source code lines (except comments) is more than 1K.
- Enough number of tests.
- Make sure the dependencies (Python libs, etc.)

### Nominate Your System

Before you move on, you should nominate your choice of system. 
For this, a nominated member of the team (and just one member) must fill in the nomination Google form: https://forms.gle/deBrJ1bDDLgMad1WA.

The list of systems currently nominated by the other teams is available here (UOS log-in required to view): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1calz98HNQT_X-9kfVVHb1olQly-dXjcVJ85GKYlbiV4/edit?usp=sharing

Once you have received confirmation from the teaching team, you can proceed to work on this system.

**NOTE**: If two groups nominate the same system, the first team to have submitted the nomination will be granted permission to work on the system, and the second team will need to choose a different system.


### Initial Commit

Once your group system nomination is approved by the teaching team, you should download the snapshot of the selected open-source legacy software system and push it as the first commit of your group repository. 

Please note:
- In the initial commit message, please specify the original repository link and the commit ID of the snapshot you downloaded. 
- Please don't start reengineering before you push the initial code to your group repository. All your reengineering efforts must be in your group repository.
- This README you are reading is just for the initial instructions. You can rename/remove in your initial commit.

## Next Steps

Follow the Group Project instructions available on the Blackboard.

## Few Remarks on the Use of Your Group Repository

In your repository, you must make fine-grained commits with clear commit messages (e.g., “initial analysis”, “new tests added for X”, and “refactoring Y”). Note that the commits in your repository will be used for assessment. Do not commit everything in a single go. The point is that you make regular, atomic commits as you work on this. 

In addition to code commits, you are strongly encouraged to use GitHub Issues and Projects in your group repository to communicate and collaborate better with your group members. The records in your Issues and Projects can be used as evidence for adjusting individual scaling factors if needed. 

For more information on how to use GitHub Issues and Projects, please refer to the following pages.
